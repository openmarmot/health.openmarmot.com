this will hold the k3s config for the example website 

# AWS Elastic Container Registry Integration
I'm using my ECR solution : https://github.com/openmarmot/ecr_with_kubernetes


# k3s_deploy.sh
this is a handy script that coverts references to environment variables in the
yaml file to the actual values of the env variables (ask kubectl won't do this 
on its own)

Note how I'm using it to get the aws account number. pretty neat
